### This will probably mostly just be a place to keep notebooks. So:

### Assorted topics

[Here's a Jupyter notebook about odds ratios that I made.](https://noahmotion.github.io/odds_ratios.html)

[Here is a first notebook (of a planned N) on signal detection theory](https://noahmotion.github.io/Signal%20Detection%20Theory%2C%20Part%201.html)

[Here is a second notebook (of a planned N) on signal detection theory](https://noahmotion.github.io/Signal%20Detection%20Theory%2C%20Part%202.html)
